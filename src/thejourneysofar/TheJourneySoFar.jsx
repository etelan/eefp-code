      <p className="description">
In 2024, we staged four mobilisations at the British Museum demanding that it cut ties with BP. We have brought together hundreds at each mobilisation, and have even been joined by visitors and passersby.      </p>

      <p className="description">
On 11 February 2024, we launched our first occupation of the British Museum where we shut down the Museum for the afternoon.       </p>

      <p className="description">
On 25 March 2024, we picketed the British Museum for an entire day, with visitors joining us in support of our campaign.       </p>

      <p className="description">
On 8 June 2024, we joined BP or not BP and Parents For Palestine in a weekend of action, occupying the British Museum's courtyard with child-friendly activities, such as chalking on the grounds messages of protest, as BP or not BP constructed a mosaic inside the Museum's Great Hall.       </p>

      <p className="description">
On 3 August 2024, we supported culture workers in occupying the British Museum and organising teach-ins on Israel's decimation of culture institutions in Gaza. We recieved endorsement from the Public, Commercial and Services Union's Culture Group.       </p>

      <p className="description">
As well as mass mobilisations, we have also disrupted the British Museum's lectures and film festivals. 
      </p>

      <p className="description">
By disrupting the day-to-day operations of BP's most prominent public partner, we have shown that wherever BP goes it will be met with resistance.       
</p>

      <p className="description"> <strong>We demand that the British Museum drop BP now!</strong></p>
